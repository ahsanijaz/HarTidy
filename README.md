Getting and Cleaning Data
==================

##Experimental Design

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
 Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 
we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been 
randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training 
data and 30% the test data. 

## Raw Data
- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

 The raw data is in the UCI HAR Dataset folder.

## Script setting
To get the tidy data, set this as the current working dierctoy of R and run the script run_analysis.R. You will obtain the tidy data set description of which is provided in the code book.

#Assumptions and steps followed:
1. 'features.txt' contains column names for features provided in the training and testing data set.
2. 'train/y_train.txt' is the output feature and was the numeric labels were replaced with the names provided in 'activity_labels.txt'.
3. Only features containging the sub string "-mean()" and "-std()" were required.

## Tidy data
Three tidy data files were formed. 

1. The tidy data with mean and std features and training and testing data mergerd along with activity labels and subject number is provided in "tidy data.csv".
2.  Average of each variable for each activity is provided in "activity means.csv"
3.  Average of each variable for each subject is provided in "subject means.csv"

Details of tidy data are provided in CodeBook.md contained in the repository.
